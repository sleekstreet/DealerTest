# DealerTest
This step in involves a coding exercise.

Instructions:

 

-          Create a database using the attached CSV file.

-          Using the MVC architecture pattern create classes to handle retrieving and displaying the data using the following queries

o   Return all 2 door models

o   Return all 2 door models for Ford for 2014

o   How many unique models and trim for BMW for 2014

o   Return all LE 4 door sedan models

o   How many unique vehicles for each make

o   Return all BMW models with XI trim

o   How many unique models for Chevy for every year

-          Return all code used for the controller(s) and the database structure used to implement your solution.


The response is above. Install Codeigniter 3 and replace the application directory with the one above.

Links for the test with the included controllers, model, and view files are as follows for the corresponding queries needed: 

1. /twodoor
2. /twodoor/ford
3. /unique/make/BMW/trim/2014
4. /fourdoor/trim/LE
5. /unique
6. /models/make/BMW/XI   

It's funny, the next to the last request didn't give any results. It verified the database didn't have any entries with that trim type of XI.
